# Introduction

This project is designed to show the internal workings of computer.

Topics that will be covered, include:

- Machine Language
- The Central Processing Unit (CPU)
  - How a CPU performs its operations
  - Instruction Fetch-Execute sequence
  - How they are implemented
- The Control Unit
- Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Data Storage

Due to the nature of this project, this manual is subject to change over time to adapt to the progress of the students.

In this project you will be building a simple computer with a central processing unit with support for a few instructions and some memory. The instructions that will be implemented are simple operations such moving data between registers and performing simple addition operations.

By the end of the project, your computer should be able to demonstrate the operation of the following program:

```AsciiDoc
MOV A, B
INC B
MOV B, A
INC B
```

# Project Components

## Power Supply

In this project, we will be using a standard 5 volt direct current power supply. We will be connecting the positive terminal to our supply rail called `VCC` and this is by convention red colored. The negative terminal will be connected to our reference rail called ground or `GND` and is by convention black but may appear at times as blue.

In this lab, we will use `VCC`, `5V` and `+5V`

## Breadboard

In this project, we will be using a prototyping project board more commonly known as a breadboard. It contains small holes which share an electric connection with holes in the same row or column. There are two areas on the breadboard: the prototyping area and the supply rails.

The prototyping area located in the middle is where you will place the components in this project. The prototyping area has a grid of holes, identified by a letter and number written on the top and side. These holes are electrically connected in a line of five (i.e. pins 1A through 1E are all connected but not to 1F or 2A). There is a gap in the middle which will be where you put the center of your DIP (Dual Inline Package) components so that you can make connections to their pins.

The supply rails are arranged in two rows connected in a long line with a red or blue stripe next to them. They are electrically connected as indicated by the line next to them (i.e. a break in the line means a break in the connection). These are used for your power supply connection and you should attach them to `VCC` or `GND` for red and blue respectively.

## Wires

We will be using 22 gauge solid core copper wire for this project.

The wires should be properly cut and the plastic insulation must be stripped from the inner conductor before use. The amount of insulation stripped should nominally expose 6mm (1/4 inches) of wire.

## Integrated Circuit Chips

We will be using standard 300mil plastic Dual Inline Package (DIP) Integrated circuit chips for this project.

## Passive Components
### Resistor

We will be using 330 &Ohm; resistors as a means to limit current through LEDs and to serve as pull-ups on switches. The clock circuit will make use of two 22 K&Ohm; resistors as part of a resistor-capacitor (RC) tank circuit.

### Capacitor

We will be using a capacitor in the clock circuit as part of the RC tank circuit.

## Light Emitting Diodes

We will be using a strip of Light Emiting Diodes (LEDs) as a means of visualizing binary data values. These must always be using in series with a resistor so that they will not burn out.

## Switches

We will be using a strip of switches to toggle between data values.

# Data Representation

Inside the computer, we need a way of representing information, however, the only means we have is through voltage levels. The information we can store on a register is called a bit and is the absence or presence of a voltage potential relative to a common reference. The convention we have adopted is that the presence of a voltage represents a logical `1` and the absence of a voltage represents a logical `0`

## Binary

Decimal | Binary | Decimal | Binary | Decimal | Binary | Decimal | Binary
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
0 | `0000` | 1 | `0001` | 2 | `0010` | 3 | `0011`
4 | `0100` | 5 | `0101` | 6 | `0110` | 7 | `0111`
8 | `1000` | 9 | `1001` | 10 | `1010` | 11 | `1011`
12 | `1100` | 13 | `1101` | 14 | `1110` | 15 | `1111`

# Logic Gates

All logic on an IC is built from logic gates. Logic gates are a combination of transistors to form logical boolean operations. The simplest gates to produce are the NOT gate, NAND gate and NOR gate. Using these gates, more familiar gates such as AND and OR can be built.

<!-- elaborate more on gates -->

# Project 

## Introductory Labs

### Equipment and Data Representation

In this lab, we will introduce ourselves to the equipment in the lab. We will also look at what is required to represent data electrically and how to get output from it. We will set up a simple circuit to produce data values with a switch, visualize the value with an LED and then use the value produced as an input to a logic gate and then visualize the output of a logic gate.

You will have been issued a lab kit containing:

- A project board
- A power supply
- A wire cutting and stripping tool
- A chip removing tool

The project kits issued this year have the project board integrated with the power supply, an additional breadboard is also included in case you run out of space on your project board later on in the lab.

#### Before You Begin

This is a lab which deals with electricity, your lab demonstrator should have given you a quick talk about the safety of dealing with electricity. While the voltage and current levels are not high enough to cause serious injury to anyone caution must still be taken with this equipment. The equipment may also become damaged if wired improperly. If at any point you are not sure about the setup of your project board, call over your lab instructor.

__If something is not working or components become hot, turn off the power.__ Look for the issue or call over your lab instructor if needed.

__IF YOU SMELL SMOKE OR BURNING, CUT THE POWER ON YOUR POWER SUPPLY IMMEDIATELY AND CALL OVER YOUR LAB INSTRUCTOR!__

#### Steps

1. Take out your project board from the kit that was issued to you, verify that it works.
2. Hook up all supply rails to +5V and Ground on the power supply.
3. Hook up a switch pack and LED pack.
4. Use the switch to control the LED.
5. Hook up a logic gate and use switches for its input and an LED for its output.

### Circuits using Logic ICs (Half Adder)

In this lab, we will look at the circuits involved in forming logical equations. The circuit we will be using is called the half-adder which is used for adding two bits together to get a result.

In using two bits, we need two inputs, one to represent each bit. Because we are using the binary number system, we can potentially end up with two digits in the result since our addition overflows or carries into another digit (in the case of 1+1). This means we will need two outputs to represent the result.

We will be representing our inputs as A and B and our outputs as C and S. S will be the sum of the two digits and C will be the value that carries over.

```
  A
+ B
---
 CS
```
In order to construct our circuit, we will need to know the equation that represents each bit in the result. To do this, we can construct a truth table which can help us in determining the equations.

| A | B | &bull; | C | S |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | = | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | = | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | = | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | = | 1 | 0 |

The derived equations are constructed from the primitive Boolean algebra operations AND OR and NOT. These operations have corresponding logical gates which are available as DIP chips in the lab.

- The NOT gate is part number 7404
- The AND gate is part number 7408
- The OR gate is part number 7432

You will need to construct the truth table above as a configuration of logic gates such that the inputs A and B are provided by switches and the outputs C and S are visible on LEDs.

- To do this, you will need to construct the Boolean algebra equation for C and S using only the variables A and B.
- Using these equations you will modify them to use only the AND, OR and NOT operators.
- This equation will allow you to draw the gate diagram with the gates availible to you.
- Use this gate diagram and the IC pinouts provided at the end of the manual to construct the circuit.

Reminder:
- The part numbers on the chip may vary from chip to chip so ignore the letters.
- SN74HCT04 would be referred to simply as 7404.

### Latches, Flip-Flops and Registers

In the last lab, we looked at how we can construct a circuit for any given truth table. In this lab, we will look at how we can use this and some new parts to build other components of a computer. 

## Latches

A computer does not always require that the input for its operations be present at all times. It uses memory to hold inputs for when it needs them and can store results to memory for later. Latches provide the facility to do this and are build by a cross-coupled pair of NAND gates or NOR gates. Cross-coupling is when the output of one gate is used as the input for the other and vice-versa. This creates a feedback in the circuit which is used to store a one bit value. The other inputs allow the feedback to be changed thus changing the stored bit value. This is what is known as an R-S latch. It has two inputs (R and S) and two outputs (Q and ~Q).

| R | S | Latch Behavior | 
|:-:|:-:| -------------- |
| 0 | 0 | Retains value  |
| 1 | 0 | Stores a 0     |
| 0 | 1 | Stores a 1     |
| 1 | 1 | Undefined      |

The R-S latch does not provide the ideal means for sampling a value to store. For this, we add some logic in front of the RS latch to create a D latch. With the D latch we have inputs D and E which feed R and S so that when E is 0, we retain a value and when E is 1, we store the value on D.

| D | E | &bull; | R | S |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| X | 0 | = | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | = | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | = | 0 | 1 |

X in this case is used to denote the "Don't Care" input where the value can be either 0 or 1 for this particular output as when E is 0 we are retaining a value and D is not used under this case.

![Gate Diagram of D Type Latch](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/D-Type_Transparent_Latch.svg)

In this part of the lab, you will construct a D type latch and test its ability to store a value.

![Example circuit for Lab 3](https://rawgithub.com/er1/s228/master/lab3_bb.svg)

## Flip-Flops

Latches are level-triggered which in the case of D latches, means that when the level of E is high (E = 1) it stores the value from D which may change change while E is high. This is not an ideal behaviour because we would like to sample a particular value at a particular time. This behavior is called edge-triggered and is the moment when a value changes in a particular direction. The positive edge or rising edge is when a value goes from 0 to 1 and the negative edge or falling edge is when a value goes from 1 to 0. 

A flip-flop is two chained D-type latches such that the D input for the second comes from the Q output of the first. E is inverted for the second one. This means that at all times, E is keeping the value locked for exactly one of the latches in the flip-flop.

## Project Labs

At this phase, we will start building the lab project for the rest of the course. You may clear off everything on your project board up until now as it will not be needed. Pay close attention to wiring as from now on we will be keeping everything on the project until the end of the project and poor wiring will make locating mistakes in the lab much more difficult.

### System Clock / Clock Signal Generator

In this lab, you will be building system clock for your computer. The system clock is an alternating signal changing from 0 to 1 and back at a regular interval. This signal is used to provide a changing input which can be used to make the computer work autonomously. Without this signal, the computer would need the user to make a change in inputs for every phase of computation similarly to how in the preliminary labs, our outputs only ever changed when an input was changed.

The primary function of a CPU is to perform a set of operations called instructions. These instructions have an almost one-to-one relationship with lines of code in assembler language (which will be seen in the tutorial for this class) and perform operations such as copying a value from one register to another or more complex operations such as arithmetic and memory access. These instructions may need to occur in several phases so the system clock needs to be expanded into several clock signals where we will have one for each phase. In this lab, we will be constructing a fixed four phase clock generator (meaning that each instruction has four phases, even if some do not use all of them and that number is fixed).

We will introduce two new logic chips for this purpose.

- The 555 chip which is a chip used to control timing. We will wire it up in asyncronous mode so that it generates the alternating signal from one to zero. This setup uses an RC tank circuit to control the timing of the signal meaning the values of the resistors and capacitor control how fast the value changes.

- The 74164 chip which is a serial-in-parallel-out (SIPO) shift register. A SIPO shift register is a chip with several flip-flops chained up internally so that all the outputs of each flip-flop are accessible on their own pin and where the inputs are provided by the preceding flip-flop's output. The first input is made accessible on a pin which we use to shift values in.

We will be using the clock signal to generate a clock for the shift register so that it can shift values on its own. The value that we shift in will be based on the values that are already in the register and will be such that there is only one zero in the register (i.e. shifting in 1 unless the register contains all 1s).

![Example circuit for Lab 4](https://raw2.github.com/er1/s228/master/lab4_bb.png)

### Buses and Registers

In this lab, you will be building the CPU buses for your computer. A CPU bus is a common system such that registers can move values between each other. In this lab we will build two buses, one where all the registers outputs are attached to one of the ALU inputs, and one where the register inputs are attached to the ALU output. Since the ALU has two inputs, the remaining input will be attached to a controllable 0 or 1.

A Register is a Flop-Flop with a Tri-State buffer attached to make the output controllable. This gives a device which can be attached to a bus for both inputs and outputs. The register will read off the bus attached at its input just as a flip flop would when its enable line is triggered, this works because one output can feed several inputs. The Tri-State buffer allows the output to be controlled by electrically disconnecting it so that we can allow only one value to be output on the bus at a time. Without it, the bus would be attached to more than one output leading to conflicting signals on the bus.

There will be a 10% __deduction__ on the lab grade if you fail to include your name or __group number__ on your report. There will be a 40% __deduction__ in lab grade if you fail to complete the labs before the lab report deadline.

### Memory

In this lab, you will be building the RAM for your computer, it will be comprised of 4 registers selected through a decoder. This will give us a 4x4 memory unit with 4 data lines and 2 address lines.

In a computer, we only have a small number of registers to store data. Typically, we need to store much more information than the registers provide us. For this reason, we use main memory. Main memory is a large array of memory units (typically flip flops) that we can access by choosing which unit we want access to through a register and performing operations to that unit as we normally would to a register. This means we need two special purpose registers in our CPU. We have a Memory Address Register (MAR) which picks which memory unit we want to access using its address (similar to an index for an array) and a Memory Data Register (MDR) which exposes the contents of a particular memory address to the CPU. It is important to note that the MAR is a write only register since we only ever specify memory locations and the MDR is not actually a register but a means of exposing memory as a register.

We are using four register as our memory units in this lab. These registers are are selected though a decoder. The decoder gets an address from the MAR and uses it to select which register should be active.

In this lab, we will also be including our Instruction Register (IR) which will be used in the next lab.
